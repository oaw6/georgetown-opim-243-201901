## Submission Instructions

The professor will assign your group to present on one of two "Demo Days".

At least two days before your designated demo day, send an email to the professor to coordinate the process of setting up your presentation on the class PC or using your own computer. Include a link to your Google Slides presentation and a link to the GitHub repository containing code you'd like to demo. If your code has any special configuration requirements, like setting environment variables, also include instructions for how you'd like to perform those setup steps.

On your designated demo day, deliver your presentation in front of the class.
