# "Freestyle" Project Proposal

> Prerequisite: ["Freestyle" Project Description](/projects/freestyle.md)

As stated in the project description, you may work on this project independently, or with a partner. If you'd like to be paired with a random partner, please alert the professor as soon as possible, so he can match student pairs together with enough time to collaboratively brainstorm app ideas.

Whether working independently, with a partner of choice, or with an assigned partner, after brainstorming, each student should submit their own [Proposal Form](https://forms.gle/pa9dMBPheaSxfAgHA) before the designated due date. The form asks for information about your team composition and your proposed idea. Partners should mutually designate each other, and may submit the same or similar responses.

Don't worry if your responses are not the most fully formed. You'll later have a chance to further refine and elaborate in the [Project Planning and Requirements Document](/projects/freestyle/requirements.md).

Here is a [reasonable example](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/repo-evaluator-py/blob/master/PLANNING.md) of responses to some questions posed in the form.

## Planning

Section header: What are you going to build, and why?

### Problem Statement

What problem would you like to solve, or what opportunity will you address? What is the impact of the problem?

### User Needs

Who are the individuals affected by the problem? How are they impacted? How could their experience be improved? What are their needs? Please include language like: "[WHO] needs [WHAT] so that [WHY]".

### Potential Solutions

Brainstorm a few potential solutions to the problem you've identified. Keep in mind, these solutions could be technical or non-technical in nature, and may or may not all involve application software. How can each of these potential solutions help the affected users? After identifying and describing a few potential solutions, compare the merits of each. If the best solution might not translate well into the objectives of this Python programming project, consider identifying a different problem which might lend itself more easily to being solved by a technology solution.

### Proposed Solution

Which solution are you proposing to implement, and why? What are the goals or objectives of such a solution? Please briefly describe the system's desired functionality at the highest possible level (e.g. "The system should send me an email every morning to share information about the day's weather forecast...").

## Investigation

Section header: How are you going to build it?

### Web Services (APIs)

Which third-party APIs, if any, might your system require in order to produce its desired functionality? Have you read their documentation or tried using them? How is it going? Please share links as necessary.

### Python Packages

Which third-party packages, if any, might your system require in order to produce its desired functionality? Have you read their documentation or tried using them? How is it going? Please share any links to package docs and/or early-stage project source code demonstrating attempts to use the prerequisite package(s).

### Hardware

Will you be attempting to run your software on a server provided by Heroku or some other provider (i.e. web app or scheduled service)? Or will your system need to integrate with other hardware like scanners and sensors? Have you tried out any of these hardware integrations? How's it going?
