## Descriptions

OPIM 243:

> Today's businesses rely on application software to perform operations, aid decision-making, and drive competitive advantage. In this introductory course, students will learn how to write practical business applications in the Python programming language. No prior programming experience is required. Throughout the semester, students will be immersed in hands-on Python programming projects and should emerge with marketable technology skills.

OPIM 244:

> Businesses can earn revenue by delivering software products and services to customers. In this course, students will explore business models and best practices involved in the production and management of application software. In addition to building upon previous Python programming projects, students will propose and manage their own application software projects from ideation to delivery. By the end of the semester, students should emerge with marketable technology and product management experience.
