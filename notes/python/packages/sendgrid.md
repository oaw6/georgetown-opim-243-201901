## Installation

Install `sendgrid`, if necessary:

```sh
pip install sendgrid
```

## Setup

First, [sign up for a free account](https://signup.sendgrid.com/), then click the link in a confirmation email to verify your account. Then [create an API Key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) with "full access" permissions.

To setup the usage example below, store the API Key value in an environment variable called `SENDGRID_API_KEY`. Also set an environment variable called `MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS` to be the email address you just associated with your SendGrid account (e.g. "abc123@gmail.com").

## Usage

Send yourself an email:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import sendgrid
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import * # source of Email, Content, Mail, etc.

load_dotenv()

SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.environ.get("SENDGRID_API_KEY", "OOPS, please set env var called 'SENDGRID_API_KEY'")
MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS = os.environ.get("MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS", "OOPS, please set env var called 'MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS'")

# AUTHENTICATE

sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(apikey=SENDGRID_API_KEY)

# COMPILE REQUEST PARAMETERS (PREPARE THE EMAIL)

from_email = Email(MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS)
to_email = Email(MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS)
subject = "Hello World from the SendGrid Python Library!"
content = Content("text/plain", "Hello, Email!")
mail = Mail(from_email, subject, to_email, content)

# ISSUE REQUEST (SEND EMAIL)

response = sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=mail.get())

# PARSE RESPONSE

print(response.status_code) #> 202 means success
print(response.body) #> this might be empty. it's ok.
print(response.headers)
```
