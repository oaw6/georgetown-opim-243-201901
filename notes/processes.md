# Processes

Businesses can use technology systems to automate and/or simplify (re-engineer) their operational processes.

## Process Diagrams

**Process Diagrams** depict the flow and scope of a process from start to finish. These diagrams are often accompanied by written descriptions of the various component sub-processes.

### Shapes

Process diagrams generally employ a standard set of shapes, each with a specific meaning:

shape | purpose
--- | ---
circle or oval | a "terminator" which indicates the start or end steps of the process
square or rectangle | a sub-process, or step in the overall process
line with an arrow | points from one step to another to indicate sequential flow, including sub-process dependencies
diamond | denotes a "decision-point" in the process, including conditions under which different outcomes are possible
square with a squiggly bottom | a "document" produced by, or related to, a step in the process

Additionally, some process diagrams use visual separators called "swim lanes" to indicate which stakeholders are responsible for each sub-process.

### Process Re-engineering

The act of describing a process in writing and creating a process diagram usually leads to a better understanding of that process. Often, analysts are able to identify ways to simplify, or re-engineer a process.
